To install AVBlog unzip the file you download directly in the folder you want to have the blog installed in.

-	If you want to use XML files as storage system you do not need to do any other operation; 
	your blog is already installed and you can access it with the browser.

- 	If you want to use Database you have to create the DB first: if you have access an empty db 
	is already provided in the storage/db folder; otherwise some sql scripts are provided in the 
	storage/db/scripts folder; please if you use access remember not to point your datasource in a 
	folder accessible from the web server.
	Once you have built your database, please insert a record in the users table (with role 'admin')
	and then you can start the blog. At first the blog is configured to work using XML, so you have 
	to log in (see later on how to do) and to change the storage system in the configuration settings.

- 	To log into the administration section you simply had to add an url parameter, mode=admin; so 
	if you installed your blog in the yourblog folder under the yoursite domain you should type:
	http://yoursite/yourblog/index.cfm?mode=admin
	
-	To upgrade the Lite version to the Full version simply download the full version and put the content of
	the /external and /plugins folder into your Lite installation folder.
