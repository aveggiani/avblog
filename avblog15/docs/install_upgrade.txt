To upgrade your AVBlog unzip the file you download in a new folder, then:

IF YOU HAVE XML STORAGE

1) 	copy your config, storage and user (and personal if present) folders from your old installation to the new folder
2) 	it's done, when launching your blog from the new folder it should work and authomatically
	upgrade your content
	
Alternatevly you can:

1) copy all the folder on the new folder except config,storage amd user into your old installation
2) it's done :), but remember to make a backup first of your old installation.

In case something fails, remember ALWAYS to remove the file, if it exists, include/version/version.cfm
and then retry one of the two methods.

IF YOU HAVE DB STORAGE

You have to make some upgrade to the DB, you can referrer to the scripts in the storage/db/scripts folder;
anyway in this release major changes was:

- Added table spamlist
- Added table enclosures
- Changed from file to sfile field name in the tables: photoblog,library
